  "text": "Had a great time speaking at the Arfa Karim Technology Incubator at National Aerospace Science & Technology Park (NASTP), as part of their Fellowship Program, an amazing initiative that’s giving our young generation the direction, skills, and exposure they truly need.\n\nI spoke about business, technology, and something we often overlook, communication. The reality is, a lack of communication skills is holding back so many talented individuals. Middlemen end up taking the credit, the money, and the opportunities, simply because they know how to present themselves better. Whether you’re in business, freelancing, or working on a startup, how you communicate can define how far you go.\n\nWhat stood out most to me was how clear-minded and focused these kids already are. That kind of clarity at this age is rare and honestly, it gives me a lot of hope.\nThis is where real change begins. The future looks bright and programs like this are helping shape it.",
